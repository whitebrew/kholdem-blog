## Seotda or Sutda is a Korean card game.
Seotda is a betting game where players use two Hwatu cards to create a high-ranking combination and outplay their opponents. These combinations are called Seotda rankings, with the highest being the "Sampal Gwang Ddaeng," which is a combination of the Sam-Gwang and Pal-Gwang cards. The lowest ranking is the "Mangtong," made up of the February and August cards. Seotda has been enjoyed since the Joseon Dynasty, and its popularity surged after the release of a hit movie based on the game, making it widely available online and on mobile platforms.

## Introduction
Seotda or Sutda is a traditional Korean card game that evolved from a gambling game known as "Tujeon," which was enjoyed by the upper class during the Joseon Dynasty. The game gained widespread popularity after the release of the film "Tazza" which was based on a manhwa (Korean comic) of the same name by Heo Young-man and Kim Se-yeong. Today, Seotda can be easily accessed and played online and on mobile devices.

The primary objective of Seotda is to combine two cards to achieve the highest possible score. Online Seotda is a digital adaptation of this traditional game, allowing players to enjoy it in a virtual environment. Below is an explanation of the basic rules and game play of online Seotda.

## ‍Game Preparation
#### Cards Used
In Seotda, 20 cards from the Hwatu (or Hanafuda in Japan, which means flower cards) deck are used.

Hwatu is a deck of 48 cards, consisting of 12 different types with 4 cards for each type. These 12 types represent the months from January to December, and each type includes a set of Gwang(bright), Kkeut(animal), Dan(ribbon), Ssangpi(double plain), and Pi(plain).

In Seotda, only the Hwatu cards representing the months from January to October are used, and among these, only 20 cards are played with: Gwang, Kkeut and Dan, excluding Pi. For those who are unfamiliar with other Hwatu games like Go-Stop, it can be confusing to understand the meaning of each Hwatu card. Below is an explanation of the Hwatu cards used in Seotda.

#### January: Pine
  In the Hwatu deck, January is represented by a pine tree. In the Seotda game, the Hwatu cards used for January consist of one Hongdan(red ribbon) card and one Gwang(bright) card featuring a crane.

## Basic Rules
#### Objective
The goal is to combine two cards to achieve the highest possible score. Each combination has a specific score and ranking.

#### Rules & Terminology

Seotda is played in a manner similar to poker. However, while popular poker games like Texas Hold'em use five cards, Seotda uses just two Hwatu cards to determine the winner. The game can be played by two or more players.

Before betting begins, a dealer (called "Seon") is chosen. There are several methods to determine the dealer, with the most common being "Bam Il Nach Jang" which means Night One(January) Day Ten(October). This method involves dealing cards to each player as if playing the game, and then revealing the cards. If the game is being played during the day, the player with the card closest to October becomes the dealer. If it is night, the player with the card closest to January becomes the dealer.

Starting with the dealer, players are dealt one card each in a counterclockwise direction, and betting begins once everyone has two Hwatu cards. During betting, players have the following options:

- **Call**: Matching the bet amount placed by the previous player.
- **Check**: An option only available to the dealer, where they pass their turn without betting.
- **Bing (Ping)**: An action only available to the dealer, where the initial bet amount is placed.
- **Ddadang (Double)**: Doubling the bet amount placed by the dealer.
- **Quarter**: Betting one-quarter of the total pot.
- **Half**: Betting half of the total pot.
- **Full**: Betting an amount equal to the total pot.
- **Die (Fold)**: Folding by revealing one’s cards and forfeiting the round.
- **Low Betting**: Betting an amount lower than the previous player’s bet.

This structure allows players to strategically place their bets and decide their actions based on their cards and the behavior of other players.

Points are assigned based on the type of Hwatu cards, and the player with the highest score at the end wins. Since Hwatu cards are not revealed during the game, a high level of psychological strategy, similar to poker, is required.

<br>

## Seotda Rankings

Ranking is called Jokbo in Seotda.

Similar to poker rankings or blackjack strategies, Seotda also has high and low rankings determined by the combination of the two Hwatu cards. These rankings can vary depending on the rules and region, so it's advisable to check the specific rankings used before playing the game.

For example, in areas like Busan or Gyeongnam, "Jang Ddaeng" is considered a higher ranking than "Gwang Ddaeng." Below is a table that provides a quick overview of Seotda rankings.
